In this mini-project, weâ€™ll tackle the exact same email author ID problem as the Naive Bayes mini-project, but now with an SVM. What we find will help clarify some of the 
practical differences between the two algorithms. This project also gives us a chance to play around with parameters a lot more than Naive Bayes did, so we will do that too.
