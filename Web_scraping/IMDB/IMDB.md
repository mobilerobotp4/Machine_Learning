# Scraping IMDB website for favorite genre of movies
## Backgroud
I am a newbie of the world of scraping websites. However, I can not resist myself from the plenty of oppertunities of researching over the booming field of data science. The other 
day I started thinking why I always have to rely on artificial dataset of Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository? Why am I not becoming my own Kagglel? I started searching on my dearest Google and came to know about web scraping. An oppertunity to be my own boss. I found plenty of example projects on web over IMDB (the movie rating) website. So, I start a project to scrap IMDB for my favorite genre. **Horror**. *Sounds scary!!!*
